Welcome to Minesweeper! In this game, your goal is to avoid mines and open safe cells, while using the WASD keys to move around and the Enter key to open cells. Additionally, you can flag cells where you believe a mine might be hidden. Flagging helps you keep track of dangerous cells and avoid mistakenly opening them.

First of all we recommend playing Minesweeper in full-screen mode to enjoy:
+ A clearer and more immersive view of the game board.
+ Better focus on the details of the game.
+ Enhanced readability of the menus and guides.
You can maximize your terminal or console window to ensure you don't miss any part of the gameplay.
