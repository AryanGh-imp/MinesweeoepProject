-Flagging Mines:
If you suspect that a particular cell contains a mine, you can flag it by pressing F. This marks the cell with a flag.
Flagging does not open the cell, but it helps you track which cells might contain mines, allowing you to avoid them in the future.

-Find the Mines:
The goal of the game is to open cells without selecting a mine. If you select a mine, the game ends, and you lose.
Cells will show a number representing how many mines are adjacent to that cell. Use this information, along with flagged cells, to avoid mines and safely clear the board.

-Starting the Game:
After choosing your difficulty level, the game will automatically start. You can use WASD to move around the board, Enter to open cells, and F to flag cells.

Selecting Difficulty Level:
The game has four difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Hard, and Custom. You can choose your desired difficulty from the main menu.
Please note that if you choose a custom level, your name will not be listed on the leaderboard.

Pay attention!!!
**Please make sure your keyboard is set to English for proper input.

**If you choose the Custom option, make sure that the size you choose matches the size of your monitor screen, otherwise the game screen image may not print properly,
forcing you to return to the main menu and go through these steps again(Max : 40)
